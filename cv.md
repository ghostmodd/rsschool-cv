## About me
When I was a child I wanted to become a programmer, but faculties of cyber sciences required great test marks on math. The last one was an absolute curse for me. However, I tried to create websites and programs using different programming languages. I even wanted to write game mode in C++!
Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity to pass the state math exam. That's why social sciences looked more benefitable and attractive for me.
Now I am a third year law student. I took up learning Fronted and JavaScript since it inspires me. I see a great abundance of opportunities programming can give me. Moreover, I am enjoyed obtaining knowledge on this topic. Actually, this is the reason why I am writing this description.

## Skills

## Code example
```
let input = ('0 -0 gfgf 343 1 -1 -100 4 16 64 100 -2 3 54.2 asd 1000003');
let result = input.split(' ');

for(let i = 0; i != result.length; i++) result[i] = +result[i];
for(let i = 0; i != result.length; i++){
    if(result[i] % 1 != 0 || result[i] == 0){
        result.splice(i, 1);
        i = i - 1;
    }
}
for(let i = 0; i != result.length; i++){
    if(result[i] % 2 != 0){
        result.splice(i, 1);
        i = i - 1;
    }
}
for(let i = 0; i != result.length; i++){
    if(result[i] < 0){
        result.splice(i, 1);
        i = i - 1;
    } else result[i] = Math.sqrt(result[i]);
}
console.log(result);
