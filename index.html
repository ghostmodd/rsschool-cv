            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>When I was a child I wanted to become a programmer, but faculties of cyber sciences required great test
                marks on math. The last one was an absolute curse for me. However, I tried to create websites and
                programs using different programming languages. I even wanted to write a game mode in C++!</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity to pass the state math exam. That's why social sciences looked
                more benefitable and attractive for me.</p>
            <p>Now I am a third year law student. I took up learning Fronted and JavaScript since it inspires me. I see
                a great abundance of opportunities programming can give me. Moreover, I am enjoyed obtaining knowledge
                on this topic. Actually, this is the reason why I am writing this description.</p>
